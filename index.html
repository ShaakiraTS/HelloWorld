            <h3 style="color:red;">Negroe Slaves in the Colonies</h3>
            <h4 style="color:red;">In The Year 1768</h4>
          <p>Whether the Creator originally formed these black people a little lower than other men, or that they have lost their intellectual powers through disuse, I will not assume the province of determining; but certain it is, that a new Negroe, (<i>as those lately imported from Africa are called</i>,) is a complete definition of indolent stupidity, nor could a more forcible means be employed for the conversion of a deist, than setting one of these creature before him, as an example of man in a state of nature, unbiassed by revelation or education.</p>
          <p>Their stupidity does not however authorize us to consider them as beasts for our use, much less to deny them all knowledge of the common salvation.</p>
          <p>The Negroes born in our colonies are undoubtedly capable of receiving instruction, and those who are born among the French are instructed in the Roman Catholic religion; but our planters are generally averse to their Negroes being taught any thing but labour, and yet the generality of our North American planters have a regard for religion, and are punctual in the discharge of its duties, as far as they think themselves obliged by them.</p>
          <p>How this come to pass must be our first inquiry; for unless the planter can be prevailed on to give his assistance, it will be in vain to propose any method for instructing his slaves.</p>
          <p>Our planters objections to their Negroes being instructed is simply this, that instruction renders them less fit or less willing to labour.</p>
